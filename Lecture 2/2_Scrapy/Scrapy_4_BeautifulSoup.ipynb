    "## Introduction to BeautifulSoup\n",
    "\n",
    "[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is a popular Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates parse trees from page source codes that can be used to extract data easily. BeautifulSoup works well with requests and other HTTP libraries, making it a powerful tool for crawling and scraping websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of BeautifulSoup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parsing HTML/XML:** BeautifulSoup can parse and navigate HTML or XML documents, even those with poorly-formed markup.\n",
    "- **Searching the Parse Tree:** It provides simple methods for searching and navigating the parse tree, such as `find()`, `find_all()`, and CSS selectors.\n",
    "- **Modifying the Parse Tree:** You can modify the HTML/XML tree, extract text, and manipulate tags.\n",

    "Let's connect the main BeautifulSoup concepts to their usage in the code above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downloading the Webpage:**  \n",
    "  The code uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of a webpage:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  url = requests.get(site)\n",
    "  data = url.text"
