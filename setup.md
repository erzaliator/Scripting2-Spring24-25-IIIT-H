# Before we begin:

In this course, we will be learning to code in Python, a beginner-friendly programming language.

Quick Terminologies:

1. Python:
   - Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows us to write clear and concise code, making it ideal for beginners like you. Python's versatility enables us to work on a wide range of projects, from simple scripts to web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

2. Libraries:
   - Libraries in Python are collections of pre-written code that offer various functionalities, making our coding tasks easier and more efficient. Python's vast collection of libraries allows us to access numerous tools, functions, and resources without having to write everything from scratch. We'll be utilizing these libraries to perform various tasks and explore exciting possibilities.

3. Conda:
   - Conda is a package manager and environment manager designed for Python programming. It helps us install, manage, and organize different Python packages and dependencies, ensuring a smooth coding experience. With Conda, we can set up specific environments for our projects, allowing us to work on different projects without conflicts.

4. IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
   - An IDE is a software application that provides a user-friendly environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. It integrates various tools and features to enhance our coding experience. We'll be using an IDE to write Python code, execute it, and quickly identify and fix any errors (bugs) in our programs. We will use the VSCode for development.

Throughout the course, we'll gradually build your programming skills, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. Don't worry if you have no prior programming experience; Python's simplicity and our step-by-step approach will make learning enjoyable and accessible to everyone.

Let's embark on this exciting Python journey together! Feel free to ask questions and practice coding as we progress through the course. Happy coding! ðŸš€

# Installations

1. We will install **vscode** - to help with our further installations. This is particularly useful for windows and mac os users: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview


2. We will setup **python, conda** on your local computer:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

Note!!!! The step Create a [Virtual Environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_create-a-virtual-environment) will be done manually by us:

3. Install conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

4. Create your conda environment and install the dependencies.
Open a terminal in VSCode and type the following commands:
```
$ conda create -n "comp_ling" python=3.8.0 ipython
$ conda activate comp_ling
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Install the **jupyter notebook** plugin: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview

6. Install **git** : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git
